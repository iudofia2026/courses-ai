    "description": "In-Person Only Course. For currently enrolled Yale students only. This course examines some of the most iconic buildings on the Yale campus by way of an extended tour that will reach back to 1716 and even project into the future at times.

Sessions will be structured around ten films, each an entry point into a broader topic, such as the Fifth and Sixth Generation directors; the Hong Kong New Wave; Taiwan New Cinema; martial arts film; commercial blockbuster; and independent documentary. Directors of interest include Jia Zhangke, Zhang Yimou, Ang Lee, Wong Kar-Wai, Ann Hui, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Tsai Ming-Liang, Ou Ning, and Feng Xiaogang. We will examine their films formally, through shot-by-shot analysis, as well as in relation to major social, political, and economic developments in recent Chinese history.

After the American Revolution, states in the North gradually abolished slavery while states in the South strengthened the institution. Between 1860 and 1880, incomes in the American South fell relative to the rest of the country, not catching up to national averages until late in the twentieth century. On top of regional inequality, discrimination and segregation prevented African-Americans from participating fully in the economy. This course will focus on the history of the Southern economy and its relationship to national patterns.

Place is where the ‘I’ goes,\" claims fiction writer Dorothy Allison. \"Place is what that ‘I’ looks at, what it doesn't look at.\" This course examines a wide range of place-based literature, from long-form urban portraits to travel memoir excerpts, with a focus on the particular authorial persona driving each piece. Readings by writers such as Gretel Ehrlich, Binyavanga Wainaina, Leslie Jamison, James Baldwin, Geeta Kothari, and Pico Iyer will acquaint students with the techniques by which journalists and writers capture the essential qualities of a place, and negotiate their own presence within the context of that place portrait. Founded on the creative principle that \"constraints bear fruit,\" this course demands that students employ specific writing prompts—creative directives that develop their skills in rendering place in evocative and singular ways.

Digital media has absorbed television into a broader category of serialized content that is now intermediated by all manners of consumptive platforms and delivery systems.

Considers activist responses to fascist governments, ideologies, and tendencies in the 1930s and 1940s and the legacies and resurgent memories of fascism in the United States in subsequent decades. Drawing from a broad array of scholarship, we examine how a framework of antifascism within the black freedom struggle served to critique and combat racism and racial hierarchy, Jim Crow segregation, right-wing social movements, demagoguery, militarism, imperialism, and other more insidious forms of white supremacist state violence. 1 Credit.

    "description": "Course Cancelled. Online Course. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed a tragic disconnect between the science of global health research and the communication of scientific findings to policymakers, the general public, and scientists in other fields. Global Health Across Audiences specifically addresses this concern by exploring the intersection of academic research and public health communication. Using contemporary global health issues, students learn key scientific principles of public health and epidemiological research and then discover how to translate these principles to various scientific, semi-scientific, and non-scientific audiences. It trains students on the methods and dynamics of communicating scientific findings using a variety of mediums and genres tailored for specific audiences, including narratives, op-eds, storytelling, interviews, online platforms, filmmaking, and others, to clearly and effectively communicate global health research.

    "description": "Course Cancelled. Online Course. What does it mean to picture the self? This course will look at the long history of artistic representations of the self in western art before and after photography. We’ll explore the selfie as a uniquely modern form of self-expression, economized self-promotion, and political subversion at the same time that we consider its roots in the broader history of self-portraiture in the arts. Spanning a period bracketed by contemporary artist selfies on one hand and Albrecht Dürer’s 1500 self-portrait on the other, we’ll consider how artists have historically framed and pictured the self in painting, sculpture, and the graphic arts. This course will draw on objects from the Yale University Art Gallery and the Yale Center for British Art as well as from major art collections worldwide. At the same time, we’ll explore self-representation on social media outlets such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. In examining depictions of the self across such varied media, we’ll determine how notions of self-presentation in the arts intersect with questions of individualism, identity, commodity culture, and self-promotion from 1500 to today. 1 Credit.

The advent of the electronic medical record has made coded data richer and more readily available for analyses. This course introduces students to the terminology surrounding health care data and databases; data sources; and the practical steps to consider when requesting and analyzing health care data for quality improvement and research. The course provides students the tools to use health care data to assess and improve patient care and outcomes. Several examples of sophisticated analytical methods developed at a large academic medical center are used to illustrate concepts related to population definition, defining episodes of care, and measuring clinical, operational, and financial outcomes.

What should a self-driving car do in a crash when every likely outcome leads to the death of some number of innocent people? Should we use virtual reality or chemicals to make us feel happy? Is it ethical to use social media to call out bad behavior? Who’s responsible when a drone kills a civilian? Does playing violent video games make us bad people? Can an algorithm be racist? We will apply classic debates in applied ethics to case studies in technology, learning how to apply philosophical argument to questions about our ethical obligations, the nature of being human, and what it means to lead a good life. Topics include moral dilemmas and self-driving cars, bio-medical and genetic enhancement, punishment and online shaming, social media and friendship, responsibility and autonomous weapons, social equality and AI.

    "description": "Online Course. Mathematical modeling is not a scripted procedure. Models are constrained by physical principles, including conservation laws and experimental observations but this does not provide a closed description. There is a lot more art in mathematical modeling than is commonly acknowledged and improvisation plays a significant role.  The artistic aspects are important and intellectually engaging because they often lead to a deeper understanding. This course provides a general introduction to engineering analysis and to chemical engineering principles. Material includes the derivation of governing equations from first principles and the analysis of these equations, including underlying assumptions, degrees of freedom, dimensional analysis, scaling arguments, and approximation techniques. The goal of this course is to obtain the necessary skills for improvising mathematical models for a broad range of problems that arise in engineering, science and everyday life. Students from all majors are encouraged to take this course. 1 Credit. Technology fee: $85. Tuition: $4,500. Session A: June 7 - July 9.",

Themes discussed during this course will include actual innocence, gender/race/economic bias and its effects on criminal justice, and best practices for improving our system of criminal justice. By the end of the course, students will be able to understand the impact bias has on criminal prosecutions, and the various causes of wrongful convictions. Students will also have an understanding of how society's conflicting views on the legitimacy of the death penalty inform the justice system's efforts to establish best practices in order to prevent wrongful convictions. 1 Credit.

This is a survey course on the United States Congress.  We will explore such questions as: What are the causes and effects of political polarization?  How would term limits affect policy outcomes?  What is the effect of money on Congress?  Where do/should constituents fit in in all this?  How does Congress interact with the President and the bureaucracy? How does one run for office?  Why is Congress’s approval rating lower than any other institution in the country?   The course is divided into two parts. In Part I, we discuss the theoretical and historical foundations of legislative government the United States. In Part II, we move beyond theories of legislating and on to the way Congress operates in practice. Enrollment limited to 20 students. 1 Credit. Technology Fee: $85. Tuition: $4,500.
