The course will also introduce students to archival methods for the study of history. Taught from a classroom in the Beinecke Library, each class meeting will begin with a discussion of historical writings upon a particular theme of this history. Then we will turn to an archival collection from one of Yale’s repositories that sheds light upon this theme. Students will learn to transcribe and analyze historical documents, and then to make meaning of the past from their investigations. Topics include slavery and slaveholding, the transatlantic slave trade, the continental slave trade, the abolitionist movement, the Black experience in northern cities, Yale University, and the afterlives of racial slavery as evident in material culture. 1 Credit.

    "description": "In-person Course. This seminar examines Asian American history and culture through the lens of affect. Whether the political demands of revolutionaries and rebels in the 1970s, the broken English of stereotyped Asian immigrants on TV, or the melancholic musings of \"cut fruit\" diaspora poets, affect—in other words: emotion, or etymologically, the capacity to \"move\" or be \"moved\"—generates social constructs around Asian American race, gender, and sexuality. Historically, affect has worked with and through the economic, the political, and the cultural to generate categories including (but not limited to) the orient, the indebted refugee, and the model minority. By studying a range of contemporary cultural representations—across poetry, literature, film, and music—students will consider how Asian Americans reproduce and/or trouble these reductive tropes by exhibiting and embodying their own dis/affective poetics and politics. Example texts and themes include but are not limited to: Yoko Ono, Ocean Vuong, Crazy Rich Asians, Beef, Kim’s Convenience, nerds, rave culture, \"sad girl music,\" and YouTube personalities (nigahiga, Lilly Singh, and Wong Fu Productions).

    "description": "Online Course. This seminar explores the phenomenon of digital platforms – intermediary infrastructures that connect end-users and complementors. These platforms have emerged in diverse socio-economic contexts, including social media (e.g., Instagram), video streaming (e.g., Twitch), digital labor (e.g., Uber), and e-commerce (e.g., Amazon). The course offers a multidisciplinary perspective on studying these platforms, viewed as an amalgamation of firms and multi-sided markets, each with their own distinctive history, governance, and infrastructures. Throughout this course, we will delve into the transformative role of these platforms in areas such as culture, labor, creativity, and democracy. Our discussions will draw upon comparative cases from the United States and abroad. In addition, the seminar aims to facilitate an in-depth dialogue on contemporary capitalism and the process of cultural production. We will engage with pertinent topics like inequality, surveillance, decentralization, and ethics in the digital age. Students are invited to contribute to these discussions by bringing examples and case studies from their personal experiences. 1 Credit. Session B: June 30 – August 1. Tuition: $5270.

    "description": "In-person Course. This course will take a hard, imaginative, speculative, and poetic look at U.S. history of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries through the lens of film and video. In a time where we are awash with moving images in our environments on a daily, if not minute-by-minute basis, this course will be a space to meditate upon the sights, sounds, and texts around us.  We will interrogate how we have been trained to read a moving image. We will place the image historically, aesthetically, politically. We will learn how to see history as a series of discontinuities, yet with unconscious repetitions, thematic overlaps, and eternal returns — not simply as a single thread of greatest hits and milestones moments. Topics will include: Empire, Language, Love (viz. the Screwball Comedy), Class, War and Empire, Politics, Communism, Ideology, Youth, Revolt, Postmodernity, the Network, and Memory. Periods and events covered include: The Black Freedom Struggle, The Jazz Age, the Great Depression, World War II, the Long 1960s, the U.S. failure in Vietnam, the Dot Com Boom and Silicon Valley, and contemporary activist/revolutionary movements. We will not consider the U.S. in isolation: films and discussions will inevitably take us to Latin America, to France, to Senegal, to Iran, and to the Soviet Union. We will have mandatory Monday night screenings as well; these will include moving-image work by Julie Dash, Charlie Chaplin, Frank Tashlin, Douglas Sirk, Barbara Loden, Jane Schoenbrun, Anthony Banua-Simon, Kevin Jerome Everson, Don Hertzfeldt, Vincente Minnelli, Chuck Jones, Michelangelo Antonioni, Abbas Kiarostami, Frédéric Da, Spike Lee, Walt Disney, Warren Beatty, Brian De Palma, Richard Lester, and Eric André, among a host of others. This course seeks to expand students' knowledge of the history of film, of U.S. culture, and the society in which they exist. 1 Credit. Session A: May 26 – June 27. Tuition: $5270.",

    "description": "Online Course. What is modernism?  What is modernity?  What does it mean to call something \"modern?\"  How has the field of architecture defined its relationship to the modern, as such?  How have architects articulated this idea in their buildings and writings?  How have different cultures and countries employed and engaged with the concept of modernity?  This course will address these and other, related questions through the exploration of a range of buildings, artworks, texts, and intellectual movements, emphasizing the transmission, translation, reception, and transformation of modernist approaches to architecture and urbanism, from their roots in the 19th century to their continued dissemination on the global stage today.  Key themes will include: the role of technology and scientific development in the evolution of architectural character; the architectural response to industrialization and urbanization; the emergence and development of novel building types; the translation and transformation of regionally specific strains of modernism; and the shifting dialogue over the course of the last century between architecture and the other arts, including various forms of new media.

    "description": "Online Course. In courses on the ancient Mediterranean, women are often treated as a ‘tourist topic’, included in syllabi as a one-off detour from the historical narrative governed by elite male political, military, and socio-economic activity. This course seeks to redress this systemic issue by centering women in telling the story of the ancient Mediterranean. The first class is devoted to a historical, methodological, and theoretical introduction to the study of women and gender in classical antiquity. We then proceed thematically, each meeting centered on one category of female experiences and male perceptions of them. Tackling case studies drawn from across the Mediterranean world, from the Bronze Age to Late Antiquity, we learn how to engage responsibly with a variety of evidence types, including literature, medical texts, art, and archaeology. The structure of the course is inherently experimental: within each session, we work across the geographical and chronological boundaries typically used in courses on the Greek and Roman worlds. Through this comparative, interdisciplinary approach, the richness of each case study will come into focus in new and exciting ways, allowing for a fuller appreciation of the diverse social, cultural, and political landscapes through which women moved.

    "description": "Online Course. The Hong Kong New Wave (1980s-2000s) was an intensely creative period of film and cultural production whose influence continues to reverberate through the world today. This course will survey key figures, works, trends, and contexts of the Hong Kong New Wave movement, beginning with proto-New Wave developments in the 1960s and 70s and ending with its afterlives in recent Hollywood productions. Sessions will be structured around ten films by directors including Wong Kar-Wai, Tsui Hark, Patrick Tam, Tang Shu Shuen, Angie Chen, Stanley Kwan, and Ann Hui. We will examine their works formally, through shot-by-shot analysis, as well as in relation to broader cultural and political developments, such as the 1967 anti-colonial riots, the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising, the 1997 handover, the formation of new ciné-clubs and film magazines, the rise of television and piracy, and recent pro-democracy movements. We will also consider pertinent questions of genre, stardom, reception and fandom, history and memory, gender and sexuality, protest and dissent, and what constitutes \"Hong Kongness\" in relation to postcoloniality, globalization, and nationalism. 1 Credit.

    "description": "Online Course. This course introduces students to the economics of environmental protection and management of natural resources, and various topics in this area of study. Is climate change real or a myth? How much would you pay to protect tigers from poachers? How can governments protect the world’s marine reserves or regulate energy markets? Can we prevent the killing of dolphins resulting from tuna fishing? What are the environmental effects of economic growth and international trade? The course will begin with an overview of relevant economic concepts such as cost-benefit analysis, efficiency, market failure, externalities, and public goods. Using a basic pollution model, the course will demonstrate the impact of economic activities on local and global environmental outcomes and teach students how economists analyze alternative policy options for reducing environmental damages that stem from human activities. Course topics include management of nonrenewable and renewable natural resources, open access resources and tragedy of the commons, methods of valuing ecosystems, energy efficiency, the relationship between trade and global environmental problems, and global climate policy.

    "description": "In-person Course. This course is designed to encourage grappling with some of the central questions in today's animal ethics literature and several prominent approaches to them. Among these questions are more fundamental ones concerning how to even approach questions surrounding the moral status of the animals and our treatment of them, as well as more derivative questions concerning particular practices. Included among these questions are: What moral status do animals have (indeed, is this even an illuminating question to ask)? In virtue of what do they have that status (e.g. is it in virtue of their intrinsic properties, or something else entirely)? Supposing animals do count morally, do humans still count more? What role, if any, should considerations of human happiness, virtue, and relationships play in our moral theorizing about animals? So (some of) the other animals have a right to life? A right to flourish? Is it morally permissible to keep pets, or should we work toward a future without domesticated animals? And what, if anything, does addressing the situation of non-human animals have to do with addressing other social justice issues? We explore these questions through a variety of ethical frameworks, including utilitarian, deontological, virtue-ethical, and feminist ones. Enrollment limited to 20 students. 1 Credit.

Students will critically consider the meanings of \"sickness,\" \"health,\" and \"poverty\" in this course. Further, the seminar will acquaint students with federalism and theories of \"the state,\" as well as provide them an understanding of the mechanics of the US welfare system; the ways it shaped and was shaped by constructions of gender, race, disability, and class; and how it has overlapped with the carceral state. Readings throughout the course will urge students to consider how poverty and health are measured, who they are measured by, and what it has meant to be poor and/or unhealthy in the United States during the twentieth century. This is a reading-intensive course designed for undergraduate students who have an interest in US history. While a prior introduction to US history is helpful, no prerequisite is required. Any student excited about the topic and willing to sharpen their analytical, investigative, and reading skills is welcome. Enrollment limited to 18 students. 1 Credit. Session A: May 26 – June 27.

    "description": "This introductory course in the Principles of Health Policy and Management (PHPM) is designed to cultivate a working knowledge of both theoretical concepts and practical applications to equip students with the policy knowledge and understanding to ensure that their research efforts are targeted to have the greatest potential relevance and impact for patients and on health systems. The curriculum provides exposure to the fundamental principles and practices in health care policy, financing, and delivery, as well as health care management. Specifically, the PHPM course covers: a) the fundamentals of health economics and US health care delivery and financing, including both public and private sectors; b) US health care policy development, analysis and evaluation, with a focus on the clinician-researchers role, at the federal, state and local levels; and c) topics in health care management. The PHPM course content is taught in a seminar format using lectures, case studies, and interactive discussions, all supplemented with relevant readings (both textbook and journal articles). The course is intended for 8-15 students but could accommodate as many as 20. Sessions are focused on specific topics in lecture format, but class discussion is actively encouraged. Typically, there are 16-18 PHPM sessions scheduled over a 6 month period from July through December, as we retain some flexibility to add sessions if the class discussion requires. Sessions are scheduled approximately weekly over the Summer and then every other week through the Fall (and into early Winter if needed). Preparation outside of class is required, with recommended textbook chapter readings and journal articles. Permission of the instructor required.",

    "description": "This comprehensive course in Biostatistics is designed to cultivate expertise in both theoretical concepts and practical applications. Throughout the year-long program, participants will develop the skills needed to employ statistical analyses for diverse data sets and research studies. These include descriptive statistics, bivariate comparisons, multivariable analyses encompassing linear and logistic regression, survival analysis, and specialized topics such as hierarchical modeling, Poisson regression, repeated measures and time series analyses, weighting and complex survey design, as well as difference-in-differences, propensity score and instrumental variables analyses. By the course's conclusion, participants will be adept at not only conducting bivariate and multivariable statistical analyses but also critiquing and interpreting statistical methods frequently used in the medical journal literature. The summer term will cover the core methods and concepts of biostatistics, forming the foundation for the rest of the year. Class sessions (Zoom meetings) will be 2 hours long twice per week and will include review and clarification of new material as well as interactive Stata exercises and lab assignments. Lectures, which include the basic math and intuition behind each method/concept, are pre-recorded in segments up to an hour to allow for asynchronous viewing prior to class time. Students are expected to review and be prepared before each session. This will allow more time for discussion and class activities to practice concepts. A quiz accompanies each class session to assess progress and areas for clarification; a lab accompanies each class session to apply concepts using Stata. Permission of the instructor required.",

We will use case-based exercises to analyze topics that have contemporary relevance to be medicine, e.g. development of screening programs for cancer or reporting and reduction of medical error. These exercises will utilize collaborative approach aimed at developing several distinct skills: defining the scope of a complex problem; reducing a problem into definable parts; examining each part from multiple angles; prioritizing the parts and their potential solutions; and committing to an actionable solution while acknowledging unaddressed complexities and unknowns.

Independent Research in the Summer consists of special projects initiated and arranged by the student in an area of academic interest under the mentorship and supervision of a Yale faculty adviser and with the approval of the relevant Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS). In general, IDRS S300 enables the student to study material not otherwise offered by the department. The course may be used for research, design or other projects, or directed reading, but in all cases, a term paper, a written report on the research project, or an equivalent final assessment as determined by the faculty adviser and the DUS is required. The student is expected to meet regularly with their faculty adviser and spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for the duration of the five-week session. Students may receive academic credit only if they are not being paid for their research, although they may work for credit in one five-week session and for pay in the other. Upon completion of the course, the faculty adviser must submit to the Yale Summer Session Registrar a substantive report, which describes the nature of the independent research and evaluates the student’s performance in it. The report must indicate the mark of Pass or Fail. These reports should be shared with the student and the DUS and, for Yale College students, kept in the office of the student’s residential college dean.

    "description": "In-person Course. This is a course about language as a window into the human mind and language as glue in human society. Nature, nurture, or both? Linguistics is a science that addresses this puzzle for human language. Language is one of the most complex of human behaviors, but it comes to us without effort. Language is common to all societies and is typically acquired without explicit instruction. Human languages vary within highly specific parameters. The conventions of speech communities exhibit variation and change over time within the confines of universal grammar, part of our biological endowment. The properties of universal grammar are discovered through the careful study of the structures of individual languages and comparison across languages. This course introduces analytical methods that are used to understand this fundamental aspect of human knowledge. In this introductory course students learn about the principles that underlay all human languages, and what makes language special. We study language sounds, how words are formed, how humans compute meaning, as well as language in society, language change, and linguistic diversity. 1 Credit. Session B: June 30 – August 1.

    "description": "Online Course. The last few years have witnessed significant improvements in artificial intelligence and virtual reality technologies. Within our lifetimes, it may become possible to spend time in extremely realistic computer simulated worlds, populated by artificially intelligent agents. This prospect forces us to grapple with a host of important questions, including: whether artificially intelligent agents will ever achieve consciousness and moral status; whether we could survive ‘uploading’ our minds into a virtual reality; whether or not this would be good for us; and whether we can know if we are already living inside a simulation. In this class we will discuss all of those questions, as well as several ethical dilemmas posed by present-day technologies like dating apps and self-driving cars. (Is it immoral to ‘swipe left’ on potential romantic partners based on physical appearance? How should self-driving cars handle ethical trade-offs?) The class will not presume any background in philosophy or technology studies, and will use technological developments as a springboard into philosophy. 1 Credit. Session A: May 26 – June 27.

    "description": "Online Course. In this course, students learn how to critically evaluate Hollywood’s representation of aspects of modern physics (relativity, quantum mechanics and modern-day climate change). After being given the background physics and quantitative training required to understand a particular topic, students will typically be shown a movie clip and asked to quantitatively judge the veracity of the physics in the scene. Is it a good or bad representation of what happens according to the laws of physics? Assignments will involve both solving physics word problems and explaining how physics concepts are used in movies. If you claim movies such as \"Interstellar\" or \"The Day after Tomorrow\" violate the laws of physics, you need to be able to back up that claim with sound physical reasoning. This is what students learn to do in Hollywood Astrophysics. Enrollment limited to 20 students. 1 Credit. Session B: June 30 – August 1. Tuition: $5270. Technology Fee: $85.",

    "description": "In-person Course. Sociology is the foundation of the social sciences. It involves the systematic and rigorous study of human social relations, social structures, and social causes and consequences of human behavior. Studying sociology allows students to acquire what C. Wright Mills called the sociological imagination: the ability to think beyond our personal lives and to connect the experiences of individuals within the context of broader social forces. This introductory course provides a broad view of sociology by covering its major theoretical traditions (e.g., Marx, Weber, Durkheim, and Du Bois), primary research methods (interviews, ethnography, surveys, experiments, and social network analysis), and select substantive topics (e.g., socialization, family, race/ethnic relations, gender, culture, deviance, and social stratification). This course will primarily draw on readings and examples from the United States, though cross-national comparisons will also be incorporated whenever possible.

This seminar reads illustrative texts of dramatic literature from the Anglo-European world in, roughly, the twentieth century and the two adjacent \"turns of the century.\"  We will read with an eye toward discovering the unique ways authors adjusted theatrical form, content, and event to new conditions of modernity.  Our specific focus will be close-reading plays, looking at how playwrights create worlds through devices such as plot, characterization, imagery, etc., as well as through the conception of the audience/performer relationship; considerations of time, tempo, musicality; visual dramaturgy; non-linearity and repetition; coding and transcribing; and other dramaturgical devices that took on unique importance and new forms in the modern era.  We will read one play a week, establishing its historical context and examining different approaches of playwriting and world-making. For college students and beyond. 1 Credit.

    "description": "Online Course. The focus of this class is the digital making of still color photographs with particular emphasis on the potential meaning of images in a photo-saturated world. Through picture-making, students develop a personal visual syntax using color and composition for effect, meaning, psychology and narrative possibility. Students produce original work using a required digital camera. Introduction to a range of tools including color correction and fine-tuning. Assignments include prompts, regular critiques with active participation and a final project. Lectures examine the progression of photography as fine art medium and the tradition of handheld, natural-light photography through the 20th century and into contemporary practices in the 21st, focusing on a diversity of voices. Images are discussed and critiqued projected onscreen, and the focus is on the image rather than on the print as object, as students will not learn inkjet printing or have after-hours lab access in this course. Students must have access to a digital camera (DSLR, point-and-shoot or smartphone) and bring it to class.  Enrollment limited to 16 students. 1 Credit.

How have authors attempted to make sense of the philosophical complexities of multiple futures?

    "description": "Online Course. Mathematical modeling is not a scripted procedure. Models are constrained by physical principles, including conservation laws and experimental observations but this does not provide a closed description. There is a lot more art in mathematical modeling than is commonly acknowledged and improvisation plays a significant role.  The artistic aspects are important and intellectually engaging because they often lead to a deeper understanding. This course provides a general introduction to engineering analysis and to chemical engineering principles. Material includes the derivation of governing equations from first principles and the analysis of these equations, including underlying assumptions, degrees of freedom, dimensional analysis, scaling arguments, and approximation techniques. The goal of this course is to obtain the necessary skills for improvising mathematical models for a broad range of problems that arise in engineering, science and everyday life. Students from all majors are encouraged to take this course. Prerequisite: student must have a knowledge of basic calculus. Enrollment limited to 25 students. 1 Credit. Session B: June 30 – August 1.

We will ask many questions of these texts, not the least of which is \"what do we mean when we say ‘American?’\" Given the wide range of the body of work that comprises American literature, however, we will also periodically ask in passing what we mean by \"literature,\" so as to consider what roles the literary plays in creating and shaping the possibilities of social imagination, private and public discourse, as well as one’s own identity. Emphasis on analytical reading, critical writing, and class discussions. Authors include Melville, Poe, Hawthorne, Whitman, Dickinson, Barnes, Toomer, H. Crane, W. C. Williams, L. Hughes, and M.

This course examines constitutional principles of due process and fair trial, and how bias influences the criminal justice system, focusing on wrongful convictions and the death penalty. Ethical considerations are a key component of the course. Iconic films demonstrate the issues presented. Topics include the efficacy of the death penalty, the causes of wrongful convictions, actual innocence, gender/race/economic bias and its effect on the justice system, and best practices for improving our sense of justice in the United States. This course explores the varying roles of the court, the prosecution and the defense in criminal cases, including analysis of ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Students develop an understanding of conflicting views on the legitimacy of the death penalty and the systemic problems with instituting capital punishment, as well as best practices to prevent wrongful convictions. Enrollment limited to 20 students. For college students and beyond. 1 Credit.

An introduction to (and examination of) central issues in musical meaning by way of focusing on the phenomenon of the \"cover song.\" A cover song is performance or recording of a song that was previously recorded or performed by someone else. Cover songs are never just performances pure and simple but rather they are commentaries on previous performances. Thus, they reveal how aspects such as genre, timbre, tempo, arrangement, harmonization, lyrics are not just basic musical concepts but crystallize social and historical relationships. The course will examine the cover song across genres and time. Some course sessions will involve focus on individual songs, other sessions may look at groups of songs to address specific musical, social, and historical issues and key concepts in musical meaning. Readings will include musicological histories and commentaries on individual songs as well as philosophical reflections on aspects of musical meaning. Students should leave the course with a better understanding of how music means as well as a broader grasp of musical repertoire. Enrollment limited to 20 students. 1 Credit.

    "description": "In-person Course. How did politics begin? Aristotle suggested that the answer ought to be self-evident—at least to a noble audience. Citing the poet Hesiod, he also placed a priority on \"speaking well.\" But what if one has not been blessed from birth with noble station? And how do we decide what amounts to speaking well?  Welcome to Writing About Politics! In this class, you will experiment with several forms that writers on politics have made their own over time. Profile writing, opinion-driven analysis of empirical trends, and satire will all be part of the mix. We will look at some ideas from antiquity and the Enlightenment before settling into a particular focus on the post-WWII United States. Writers whose work we will consider range from Voltaire to Sontag, from W.E.B. Du Bois to William F. Buckley, Jr., and beyond.

While Americans’ attention is often focused on events in Washington, D.C. and the activities of the president and the Congress.  Arguably, however, the policies enacted in state houses and city councils have a more direct effect on citizens’ everyday lives than the activities in our Nation’s capital.  State and local politics includes a myriad of issues that have an important effect on citizens including welfare, elections, healthcare, social policies, education, criminal law, infrastructure, and many others.  Understanding how state institutions and behavior shape policy outcomes is not only substantively interesting, but the states also provide political scientists with opportunities to examine larger questions about topics such as power, representation, and responsiveness. This course will address both how the states themselves are substantively interesting, as well as how they are used to understand broader issues in political science and governance. 1 Credit.

    "description": "Online Course. Big cities present a unique set of opportunities and challenges. They are hubs of art and culture, media and entertainment, business and finance, and food. They serve as canvases for architects and urban planners with visions for the future. They represent the greatest potential for diverse populations to intersect and thrive. At the same time, cities are often sites of injustice, economic inequality, violence, and social division. Cities constantly challenge us to forge communities on a large scale and to learn how to live harmoniously with each other. \n\n\nIn this course, we will explore city life through reading and writing about cities in several non-fiction modes. Major assignments will include a literary personal essay, a reported journalistic feature (which can be a profile), a film review about a city film, and a policy memo/proposal about a change to city infrastructure. We will supplement our course readings in these four genres with short readings in other genres, as well as with other kinds of \"texts\" (images, films, recorded talks). We will also look for opportunities to use New Haven, the city around us, as a source and a test case for our ideas. Through our study and practice of non-fiction writing for a range of audiences, we will seek to join an ongoing (written) conversation about the past, present, and future of the modern city.

    "description": "In-person Course. The question of free will matters because it seems fair to hold people morally responsible for what they do only if they act of their own free will.  But do human beings have free will? If so, what is it, and how is it related to moral and legal responsibility?  If we don’t have free will, how can we justify our ordinary moral responses: judgments of praise and blame, morally laden emotions like pride, indignation, shame and guilt, and practices of reward and punishment?  Even if much of our behavior is freely chosen, there are times when people are excused for wrongful acts or even exempted from moral responsibility altogether.  How do excuses and exemptions function?  Are we becoming a society that diminishes the value of personal responsibility by accepting too many excuses?  Or are we more enlightened and humane when we appreciate how limited personal responsibility is in the face of biological and environmental \"givens\" and historical and social circumstances that move people to behave as they do?  We shall pay special attention to the phenomenon of complicity in the wake of social pressure to comply with wrongdoing.

This course also introduces students to the organization, administration, and governance of higher education. With this foundation, students critique current higher education policy issues, debates and trends at the state and federal level with a concentration on six key issues: 1) student access, 2) financial aid and affordability, 3) technology and digital transformation, 4) accreditors and DEI, and 5) NIL (Name, Image, and Likeness) and college sports, and 6) leadership retention. The course is intended to provide a broad overview of higher education and aims to cover the breadth of the sector and not the depth. Through research and one’s intellectual curiosity, individual student groups will explore the depth of one key issue aforementioned within higher education.

And what are the defining features of what is commonly referred to as the \"global right?\" It will do so by examining primary tracts written by theologians, political philosophers, and social theorists as well as secondary literature written by scholars interrogating various movements and ideologies associated with the Right in America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Though touching on specific national political parties, institutions, and think tanks, its focus will be on mapping the intellectual similarities and differences between various right-wing ideologies. The \"Right\" emerged alongside its counterpoint, the \"left,\" as early as 1692 to describe the congregation patterns surrounding the French Monarch, but it was not until the Revolution of 1789 when it gained its current political meaning. As the French Chamber of Deputies debated the rights of man and royal veto powers it was suggested that opponents to these measures sit du côté droit, while supporters place themselves du côté gauche. The division, many complained, was too absolute and left no room for nuance or political idiosyncrasies. Yet the arrangement held, the terms stuck, and by mid-century the right had begun to be a catchall for a host of political groups, including conservatives, traditionalists, authoritarians, royalists, nationalists and papists. By the twentieth century the term would be stretched to include movements ranging from Fascism to Populism and would be used to describe the political position of political parties in the Middle East and Asia. Though primarily associated with European and parliamentary politics, increasingly the designation of the right has been applied to Evangelical and Judeo-Christian groups in the United States.

Enrollment subject to the permission of the instructors and satisfactory completion of all required preparatory course work.) This intensive five-week summer workshop takes place in Rome and is designed to provide a broad overview of that city’s major architectural sites, topography, and systems of urban organization. Examples from antiquity to the present day are studied as part of the context of an ever-changing city with its sequence of layered accretions. The seminar examines historical continuity and change as well as the ways in which and the reasons why some elements and approaches were maintained over time and others abandoned. Hand drawing is used as a primary tool of discovery during explorations of buildings, landscapes, and gardens, both within and outside the city. Students devote the final week to an intensive independent analysis of a building or place. M.Arch. I students are eligible to enroll in this course after completing at least three terms. This course does not fulfill either the History and Theory or the Urbanism and Landscape elective requirements.

    "description": "In-person Course. In this immersive course, we explore the ethical challenges shaping the AI revolution. From understanding AI’s foundations to debating its most controversial uses, we critically engage with the pressing questions that define the future of technology and society. We explore three major sets of questions. First, we look at the moral permissibility of using and interacting with AI: Are AI algorithms biased, and if so, should we still rely on them? Do digital surveillance systems violate our right to privacy? Is it moral to use AI and robots in warfare? Could advanced AI even have moral rights? Second, we look at moral responsibility and AI: When AI causes harm—such as in war and self-driving car accidents—who should bear the responsibility? Finally, we look at AI and personal relationships: Is it wrong to use AI for grief counseling, love letters, wedding vows, or eulogies? Can true friendship or romance exist between humans and machines? This course gives you the opportunity to think critically, debate passionately, and gain the conceptual, technical, and ethical tools to navigate the AI-driven future. 1 Credit.

    "description": "Online Course. This seminar invites students to explore how gender, sexuality, and citizenship intersect across the Middle East and North Africa, examining how these identities shape—and are shaped by—forces like nationalism, migration, capitalism, family, and religion. Drawing from ethnography, history, and literature, we trace how gender roles and sexual minorities simultaneously fuel and question colonial legacies that uphold racialized ideas of \"modernity.\" And ask: How do global border regimes and the political economy of intimacies that sustain them reshape what it means to be—or not to be—a citizen? Our approach extends beyond laws to include everyday acts of citizenship across national and cultural divides. Readings highlight how people navigate their lives in the everyday, from the ordinary poetry of identity and belonging to the spectacular drama of war and conflict. 1 Credit.

    "description": "Online Course. This course explores the role and functioning of the United Nations at the country level from the perspective of the three mandates or pillars of the UN Charter: Peace and Security, Development,  and Human Rights. The course will touch on the structure and financing of the Organization at the global and country levels. Students will review key documents and conventions from which the different mandates of the UN emanate and look at the partnership with other actors such as humanitarian NGOs.  This course is less about the UN as a multilateral forum of member states that take political decisions at the global level --although we will touch on this, and more about the actual results and influence in the countries in which the United Nations operates. This course will be useful for students who would be interested in pursuing international careers with the different entities of the United Nations or would like to understand better how the UN and the System of organizations function in practice.

    "description": "In-person Course. This course explores the material culture of American medicine. From instruments like thermometers and scalpels to imaging tools like X-rays and MRIs to everyday aids like glasses, prosthetics and fitness tracking apps—technology suffuses medicine today. In this course, we will analyze particular technologies as both physical and cultural objects in historical context. In addition to investigating the definition of medical technology, we will also consider a range of themes and questions, among them: why do some technologies succeed and others fail? What is the relationship between medical technology and power? How do race, class, gender, and sexuality impact the creation and use of medical technology? We will pay particular attention to the themes of expertise, authority, and identity. In addition to reading primary and secondary sources, we will work closely with materials from the Medical Historical Library. Students can expect to emerge from the course prepared to analyze medical technologies and place them in historical context in American medicine. The course will culminate in a student-run exhibition of medical technologies. Enrollment limited to 15 students. 1 Credit. Session B: June 30 – August 1. Tuition: $5270.",

    "description": "Online Course. In the 1960s, the designation \"Asian American\" emerged to encompass a diverse array of experiences, histories, languages, and cultures. This decade also marked the establishment of the first Asian American theater companies, which subsequently led to an increasing collection of plays authored by Asian American playwrights. This seminar will facilitate in-depth readings and discussions of works by fifteen contemporary playwrights whose heritage connects them to various regions across East, South, Southeast, and Western Asia. Notable figures include Philip Kan Gotanda, David Henry Hwang, Aasif Mandvi, Qui Nguyen, Jiehae Park, and Sanaz Toossi, among others. Alongside employing various analytical methods for dramatic texts, we will explore the political, cultural, and historical contexts that influenced the consciousness of Asian American playwrights during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Our aim is to gain a renewed understanding of what it means to be (and perform) Asian Americanness for both current and future generations. 1 Credit. Session B: June 30 – August 1. Tuition: $5270.
