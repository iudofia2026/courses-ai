The course, centered around a series of Country House ‘case studies’, addresses two closely related issues: the formation, character and function of country-house art collections, and the conventions, development and dynamics of pictorial and sculptural display within the Country House. The course draws upon the Paul Mellon Centre’s extensive research resources, including archival materials, correspondence, country house guides, sales catalogues, books, photographs, and newly commissioned images. An essential component of the course is regular visits to Country Houses to study collections and displays, as well as a three-day field trip.",

    "description": "This course is designed to help US students interpret London’s modern history through the city’s archives, collections, and galleries. From 1945 to the turn of the century, London has morphed from being the capital of an imperial superpower, to the heart of a fragile postwar social democracy, to its current position as the international headquarters of global finance. With these three epochs came new migrant populations, the rise and fall of state institutions, and a shifting urban landscape where the maligned urban planning of the welfare state was superseded by the luxury architecture of the free market. With a number of thematic seminars and London’s unparalleled archives and galleries to search for evidence, Collecting Postwar London attempts to look for the people, places, and practices that define half a century of national history by looking at the specific and the marginal. The course also has a secondary focus on the relationships between collections and cultural institutions. Students visit several galleries and meet the curators working with collections bringing these stories to life for the public, which shape the mode of assessment for the course.",

Beginning with the ruptures of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and European colonialism in Africa, this course traces major intellectual currents and liberation movements in the history of Black radicalism in Africa and the African diaspora. It proceeds by foregrounding the multiplicities of Blackness as a lived experience and political identity. Moving between local, hemispheric, and global perspectives, the course will explore the social and political contexts in which African and Afro-diasporic movements developed, and the ways in which they negotiated structures of racial/colonial power. By means of readings and discussion, we will consider a range of movements and ideas, including African anti-colonialism, slave revolts in the Americas, Black Reconstruction, the U.S. Black Freedom Movement, Black feminism, and Third Worldism, among others. 1 Credit.

    "description": "Course cancelled. Online Course. This course will introduce students to how to use and make sense of legal sources: statutes, judicial opinions, legislative actions, legal studies, administrative rulings, and legal history, among others. This course is intended for undergraduates who are interested in incorporating law and legal research into their scholarship, from final papers to senior theses. The course will be divided into two \"units,\" the first of which will absorb the first third of the course, and second of which will absorb the final two-thirds of the semester. The first unit will work with statutory and common law, and will instruct students on how to think with and interpret these sources, especially as legal thought has distinct and often very rigid approaches to statutory and judicial sources. The second unit will explore legal history— both the origins of U.S. American legal thought and structures— but we will also delve into legal history itself, focusing on three case studies: the laws and court structures that codified slavery; the laws and legal structures that enacted and justified settler colonialism, settler land claims, the development of the federal administrative structure that controls Native lands, and tribal courts; and the laws and delegation of powers that structure (and continue to structure) immigration. These case studies are in no way meant to offer a comprehensive account of U.S. American legal history, or to offer a totalizing or full account of slavery, immigration, or settler colonialism. Rather, they are an opportunity for students to get direct experience with reading and interpreting the law; with legal research and the distinct architecture of sources for performing that research (HeinOnline); and with scholarship in legal history and legal studies. Throughout the course, we will also reflect more broadly on what legal sources and legal history is good for, and what it might simultaneously occlude. Finally, we will also explore the form and function of the law itself: what it does, what it cannot do, and how those who sought or seek to change it have strategically approached the promises and disappointments of legal reform and intervention. 1 Credit.

    "description": "Online Course. This seminar explores the phenomenon of digital platforms – intermediary infrastructures that connect end-users and complementors. These platforms have emerged in diverse socio-economic contexts, including social media (e.g., Instagram), video streaming (e.g., Twitch), digital labor (e.g., Uber), and e-commerce (e.g., Amazon). The course offers a multidisciplinary perspective on studying these platforms, viewed as an amalgamation of firms and multi-sided markets, each with their own distinctive history, governance, and infrastructures. Throughout this course, we will delve into the transformative role of these platforms in areas such as culture, labor, creativity, and democracy. Our discussions will draw upon comparative cases from the United States and abroad. In addition, the seminar aims to facilitate an in-depth dialogue on contemporary capitalism and the process of cultural production. We will engage with pertinent topics like inequality, surveillance, decentralization, and ethics in the digital age. Students are invited to contribute to these discussions by bringing examples and case studies from their personal experiences. 1 Credit. Session B: July 1 – August 2. Tuition: $5070.

This course examines the materialization of a building, whereby students are required to physically participate in the construction of a structure that they have designed. By engaging in the act of making, students are exposed to the material, procedural, and technical demands that shape architecture. Construction documents are generated and subsequently put to the test in the field. Students engage in collaboration with each other, and with a client, as they reconcile budgetary, scheduling, and labor constraints, and negotiate myriad regulatory, political, and community agencies. The course seeks to demonstrate the multiplicity of forces that come to influence the execution of an architectural intention, all the while fostering an architecture of social responsibility, providing structures for an underserved and marginalized segment of the community.

    "description": "Course closed to further enrollment. In-person Course. This course delves into the complexities and ambiguities of globalization through architecture. From nineteenth-century treaty ports to Special Economic Zones, from the Silk Road to the Belt and Road Initiative, we will investigate how the built environment and global networks mutually condition each other. As knowledge, money, and materials circulate globally, they transform how architecture interacts with its surroundings. Architecture serves as a medium through which supranational institutions and corporations thrive and expand. Using China as its entry point, this course enriches the understanding of modern architecture by revealing how styles, environments, and technologies travel beyond their places of origin. \n\n\nCapitalizing on infrastructural investments and architectural construction in Africa, South Africa, South East Asia, and Europe, China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) activates a new mode of globalization based on old geographical affinities that have been dormant for decades, if not centuries. This course contextualizes the BRI through four historical episodes: 1910s-1940s, 1950s-1960s, 1970s-1990s, and 2013 until now. Each period corresponds with a different world conception, which this course will show through a series of architectural projects. China as a site and an actor is important because holes in the global network are as constructive as the network itself. 1 Credit. Session B: July 1 – August 2. Tuition: $5070.",

Introduction to a range of tools including color correction and fine-tuning. Assignments include prompts, regular critiques with active participation and a final project. Lectures examine the progression of photography as fine art medium and the tradition of handheld, natural-light photography through the 20th century and into contemporary practices in the 21st, focusing on a diversity of voices. Images are discussed and critiqued projected onscreen, and the focus is on the image rather than on the print as object, as students will not learn inkjet printing or have after-hours lab access in this course. Students must have access to a digital camera (DSLR, point-and-shoot or smartphone) and bring it to class.  Enrollment limited to 15 students. 1 Credit.

    "description": "In-person Course. While most social scientists have come to embrace the terms race, ethnicity and migration as everyday concepts for their research, they also comprise some of the most contentious topics in contemporary society. Adding to their complexity is that these terms can take on very different meanings for individuals, organizations and governments from different social contexts. This seminar course offers a context-sensitive reflection on the concepts of race, ethnicity and migration by incorporating voices from migrant and minority groups within and from Asia. While the majority of material focuses on social issues in East Asia, the course will also devote considerable time on case studies from Southeast Asia and South Asia, as well as many transnational studies that span over national and regional boundaries. This course does not seek to provide a definitive answer on how we should understand race, ethnicity and migration. Instead, it is designed to help students understand that different historical and geographical contexts can give rise to different interpretations of the same concepts. 1 Credit.

    "description": "In-person Course. This course will explore U.S.-Mexican borderlands literature and culture as sites of cultural politics.  The borderlands here is defined by several scholars who have theorized the term as a form of resistance to white supremacy (Americo Paredes), a unique literary formation (Sonia Saldívar), and to name a third space of queerness (Gloria Anzaldúa). Borderlands is always in relation to the political project of Chicana/o/x Studies. This course will introduce you to key works in borderlands literature from the mid-twentieth century to our contemporary moment. The novels chosen will be read in relation to visual and sonic productions that extend themes of the writing. Our goal is to explore how creative writing not only reflects the structural positionalities of people of Mexican descent living within the United States but that also form unique narrative forms, queer racialized subjectivities, and third space languages. The goal of this course is to introduce you to key authors, learn theoretical concepts related to the chosen novels and to reconsider their fictional narratives through musical sound and visual cultures that form a political arena in a given historical, political, and cultural context. 1 Credit.

    "description": "In-person Course. This course explores the \"long\" and \"global\" sixties as a period of political uprising, social transformation, and cultural revolution. Radical change took place on a global scale: the \"Third World\" emerged as a political project in the hope of overcoming a world order shaped by centuries of colonialism, war, slavery, patriarchy, exploitation. Another revolution took place in cinema: in the context of global uprisings, filmmakers sought to not only show reality, but to change it. Slogans like \"the camera as a gun\" linked the filmmaker to a guerrilla fighter. Their subjects were militant mothers, revolutionary poets, rebellious students, combative peasants and workers. They experimented with alternative strategies of storytelling and capturing reality: nonlinear narrative, montage, mobile cameras, music, dance, documentary, testimony. The sixties challenge our conception of the audiovisual medium. We will study this exceptional period in global cinema through examples from Algeria, Brazil, Cuba, France, India, Senegal, the US, and elsewhere. Students will learn to incorporate formal film analysis into an analysis of ideology, production, circulation, and consumption; broaden their film historical knowledge; and develop skills to construct compelling arguments about the politics of images. Taught in English. No prerequisites. Screenings on Monday night. Films will be subtitled. 1 Credit. Session A: May 27 – June 28. Tuition: $5070.",

    "description": "Online Course. Spurred on by rapid technological and cultural change, television content and business forms have evolved dramatically in the past twenty years. Digital media has absorbed television into a broader category of serialized content that is now intermediated by all manners of consumptive platforms and delivery systems. Today, legacy broadcast networks, cable television, transactional and subscription services all compete side-by-side in a fragile equilibrium, each pursuing viewer attention and cultural stature as exemplified by landmark shows such as \"The Sopranos\", \"Game of Thrones\" and \"Breaking Bad\". Will too much TV eventually spell its own demise? This course will examine the historical evolution, aesthetic opportunities and technological dynamics that have fueled television’s ascendency into this new Golden Era.

    "description": "Online Course. Over two billion people alive today consider the New Testament to be sacred scripture. But how did the books that made it into the bible get there in the first place? Who decided what was to be part of the bible and what wasn't? How did these decisions affect the structure of nascent Christian communities, their relationship to surrounding Greco-Roman and Jewish society, and the subsequent development of Christian churches?  How would the history of the world's largest organized religion look differently if a given book didn't make the final cut and another one did? Hundreds of ancient Christian texts are not included in the New Testament. \"What Didn't Make It into the Bible\" focuses on these excluded writings and uses them to help reconstruct the earliest Christian communities. We will explore Gnostic gospels, hear of a five-year-old Jesus throwing temper tantrums while killing (and later resurrecting) his classmates, peruse ancient Christian romance novels, tour heaven and hell, read the garden of Eden story told from the perspective of the snake, and learn how the world will end. 1 Credit.

    "description": "Online Course. The early modern travel narrative provided the primary source of knowledge about the Americas to the European public. The information and perspectives presented within these narratives offer historians insight into both empirical observations and historical perceptions of the New World. The European imagination often shaped what the travel narrator paid attention to, expected to see, and documented in the text. We will read with and against the grain to attend to silences, tropes, and caricatures within the documents. We will learn from scholars of race and ethnicity, Indigenous studies, Black diaspora, women, gender, and sexuality studies, and borderlands studies to provide them the tools, vocabulary, and theories to articulate their own ideas. Furthermore, the course will engage literary theories to examine the travel narrative as a historical literary genre, and we will consider paratextual information including annotations, errors, in-line edits, illustrations, and captions in order to piece together their interpretations. The goal of this course is twofold: to introduce you to the history of early modern Atlantic empires and, subsequently, to provide you with the skills and informative scholarship to interrogate the power dynamics of the historical archive. You will emerge from the course better understanding the early modern European state of knowledge on the Americas and the skills to grapple with the costs and consequences of colonialism and imperialism both historically and in the present-day. You will be invited to engage your own scholarly and personal interests through the analytical lenses that they apply. Enrollment limited to 20 students. 1 Credit. Session B: July 1 – August 2.

    "description": "Course closed to further enrollment. In-person Course. This seminar explores the connections between public health and poverty in American life and politics, with a particular focus on social programs intended to improve health and welfare. We will examine the social, political, legislative, and regulatory histories of the welfare state during the twentieth century, ultimately considering how these histories shaped the contemporary health and welfare apparatus and our current moment. Students will critically consider the meanings of \"sickness,\" \"health,\" and \"poverty\" in this course. Further, the seminar will acquaint students with federalism and theories of \"the state,\" as well as provide them an understanding of the mechanics of the US welfare system; the ways it shaped and was shaped by constructions of gender, race, disability, and class; and how it has overlapped with the carceral state. Readings throughout the course will urge students to consider how poverty and health are measured, who they are measured by, and what it has meant to be poor and/or unhealthy in the United States during the twentieth century. This is a reading-intensive course designed for undergraduate students who have an interest in US history. While a prior introduction to US history is helpful, no prerequisite is required. Any student excited about the topic and willing to sharpen their analytical, investigative, and reading skills is welcome. 1 Credit. Session B: July 1 – August 2. Tuition: $5070.",

    "description": "This introductory course in the Principles of Health Policy and Management (PHPM) is designed to cultivate a working knowledge of both theoretical concepts and practical applications to equip students with the policy knowledge and understanding to ensure that their research efforts are targeted to have the greatest potential relevance and impact for patients and on health systems. The curriculum provides exposure to the fundamental principles and practices in health care policy, financing, and delivery, as well as health care management. Specifically, the PHPM course covers: a) the fundamentals of health economics and US health care delivery and financing, including both public and private sectors; b) US health care policy development, analysis and evaluation, with a focus on the clinician-researchers role, at the federal, state and local levels; and c) topics in health care management. The PHPM course content is taught in a seminar format using lectures, case studies, and interactive discussions, all supplemented with relevant readings (both textbook and journal articles). The course is intended for 8-15 students but could accommodate as many as 20. Sessions are focused on specific topics in lecture format, but class discussion is actively encouraged. Typically, there are 16-18 PHPM sessions scheduled over a 6 month period from July through December, as we retain some flexibility to add sessions if the class discussion requires. Sessions are scheduled approximately weekly over the Summer and then every other week through the Fall (and into early Winter if needed). Preparation outside of class is required, with recommended textbook chapter readings and journal articles. Permission of the instructor required.",

    "description": "This comprehensive course in Biostatistics is designed to cultivate expertise in both theoretical concepts and practical applications. Throughout the year-long program, participants will develop the skills needed to employ statistical analyses for diverse data sets and research studies. These include descriptive statistics, bivariate comparisons, multivariable analyses encompassing linear and logistic regression, survival analysis, and specialized topics such as hierarchical modeling, Poisson regression, repeated measures and time series analyses, weighting and complex survey design, as well as difference-in-differences, propensity score and instrumental variables analyses. By the course's conclusion, participants will be adept at not only conducting bivariate and multivariable statistical analyses but also critiquing and interpreting statistical methods frequently used in the medical journal literature. The summer term will cover the core methods and concepts of biostatistics, forming the foundation for the rest of the year. Class sessions (Zoom meetings) will be 2 hours long twice per week and will include review and clarification of new material as well as interactive Stata exercises and lab assignments. Lectures, which include the basic math and intuition behind each method/concept, are pre-recorded in segments up to an hour to allow for asynchronous viewing prior to class time. Students are expected to review and be prepared before each session. This will allow more time for discussion and class activities to practice concepts. A quiz accompanies each class session to assess progress and areas for clarification; a lab accompanies each class session to apply concepts using Stata. Permission of the instructor required.",

    "description": "This module is designed provide instruction in the skills of teaching, observation, feedback and writing an Educational Philosophy. Through active learner-centered classes, students will engage in practicing their teaching, presentation and observation skills with their peers while also providing and receiving effective feedback. As part of the exercise of writing an Educational Philosophy, students will take a Teaching Perspectives Inventory which will provide them with a personal profile of their teaching beliefs, intentions and actions. This module also exposes learners to medical education literature on teaching theory and practice for discussion and implementation. There are experiential components outside the classroom in which the student teaches a class in their area of clinical expertise, a trained faculty observer attends the class completing a validated Observation Form. The student and faculty observer meet afterward to review the form, debrief the teaching and the student receives actionable feedback to their teaching. In addition, students attend Graduate Medical Education (GME) Committee meetings led by the Senior Associate Dean for GME. In these meetings GME Program and Associate Program Directors review the performance of resident and fellow education programs and discuss proposals for innovations and new programs to enhance the trainee educational experience. After attending two GMEC meetings and a class by the Associate Dean for GME, the students write a reflection paper on a topic of their choice on GME education. This module provides active classroom learning combined with practical experiences in education for every level of learners who students will encounter in their career. This module has been designed to provide a safe environment where learners are free to seek direction, ask questions and explore possibilities with the support and encouragement of their faculty educators.

Independent Research in the Summer consists of special projects set up by the student in an area of particular interest with the help of a faculty adviser and the director of undergraduate studies, intended to enable the student to cover material not otherwise offered by the department. The course may be used for research, design projects, or directed reading, but in all cases a term paper, written report on the research project, or equivalent final assessment as determined by the faculty advisor and DUS is normally required. The student must meet regularly with the faculty adviser. Students wishing to enroll must complete the regular application for Yale Summer Session. In addition, students must supply a 1- to 2- paragraph project description of the research to be undertaken, written in collaboration with the faculty advisor, including the proposed starting and ending dates. The student must also submit written permission of (1) the faculty advisor, (2) the Director of Summer Sciences for students in STEM, or the Dean of International and Summer Programs for students in the Humanities or Social Sciences, and (3) the director of undergraduate studies of the applicant's major department. All approvals may be submitted via email to summer.session@yale.edu with IDRS S300 and the student’s name in the subject line. Students taking Independent Research in the Summer for 1 credit should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for five weeks (either Session A or B); for 2 credits students should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for ten weeks (both Session A and B). Students may receive academic credit only if they are not being paid for doing research, but they may work for credit in one 5-week period and for pay in the other. Upon completion of the course, the faculty advisor must submit a substantive report that both describes the nature of the independent research and evaluates the student’s performance in it.  The report must include the grade (P/F). These reports should be shared with the student and the director of undergraduate studies in the department or program in which the research is based and kept in the office of the student’s residential college dean. Students are expected to work well in advance to prepare their project description and secure the required approvals, all of which must be submitted to summer.session@yale.edu by no later than the relevant application deadline, listed at summer.yale.edu.

    "description": "In-person or Online Course. Must be taken pass/fail. May not be taken as part of a senior project or be deemed to be constituent of the senior requirement. Independent Research in the Summer consists of special projects set up by the student in an area of particular interest with the help of a faculty adviser and the director of undergraduate studies, intended to enable the student to cover material not otherwise offered by the department. The course may be used for research, design projects, or directed reading, but in all cases a term paper, written report on the research project, or equivalent final assessment as determined by the faculty advisor and DUS is normally required. The student must meet regularly with the faculty adviser. Students wishing to enroll must complete the regular application for Yale Summer Session. In addition, students must supply a 1- to 2- paragraph project description of the research to be undertaken, written in collaboration with the faculty advisor, including the proposed starting and ending dates. The student must also submit written permission of (1) the faculty advisor, (2) the Director of Summer Sciences for students in STEM, or the Dean of International and Summer Programs for students in the Humanities or Social Sciences, and (3) the director of undergraduate studies of the applicant's major department. All approvals may be submitted via email to summer.session@yale.edu with IDRS S300 and the student’s name in the subject line. Students taking Independent Research in the Summer for 1 credit should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for five weeks (either Session A or B); for 2 credits students should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for ten weeks (both Session A and B). Students may receive academic credit only if they are not being paid for doing research, but they may work for credit in one 5-week period and for pay in the other. Upon completion of the course, the faculty advisor must submit a substantive report that both describes the nature of the independent research and evaluates the student’s performance in it.  The report must include the grade (P/F). These reports should be shared with the student and the director of undergraduate studies in the department or program in which the research is based and kept in the office of the student’s residential college dean. Students are expected to work well in advance to prepare their project description and secure the required approvals, all of which must be submitted to summer.session@yale.edu by no later than the relevant application deadline, listed at summer.yale.edu. For college students and beyond. 1 Credit. Session A: May 27 – June 28. Session B: July 1 – August 2. Tuition: $5070.",

    "description": "Online Course. This is a course about language as a window into the human mind and language as glue in human society. Nature, nurture, or both? Linguistics is a science that addresses this puzzle for human language. Language is one of the most complex of human behaviors, but it comes to us without effort. Language is common to all societies and is typically acquired without explicit instruction. Human languages vary within highly specific parameters. The conventions of speech communities exhibit variation and change over time within the confines of universal grammar, part of our biological endowment. The properties of universal grammar are discovered through the careful study of the structures of individual languages and comparison across languages. This course introduces analytical methods that are used to understand this fundamental aspect of human knowledge. In this introductory course students learn about the principles that underly all human languages, and what makes language special. We study language sounds, how words are formed, how humans compute meaning, as well as language in society, language change, and linguistic diversity. 1 Credit. Session A: May 27 – June 28.

Selected health and health disparities population-based data are examined as a foundation for explicating how subpopulations experience disparate health across the lifespan. Students examine how past and current policies (state, federal, tribal), politics, population-based data findings, and selected frameworks enhance or act as barriers to achieving health equity with diverse populations, systems, and/or communities.

    "description": "In-person Course. The last few years have witnessed significant improvements in artificial intelligence and virtual reality technologies. Within our lifetimes, it may become possible to spend time in extremely realistic computer simulated worlds, populated by artificially intelligent agents. This prospect forces us to grapple with a host of important questions, including: whether artificially intelligent agents will ever achieve consciousness and moral status; whether we could survive ‘uploading’ our minds into a virtual reality; whether or not this would be good for us; and whether we can know if we are already living inside a simulation. In this class we will discuss all of those questions, as well as several ethical dilemmas posed by present-day technologies like dating apps and self-driving cars. (Is it immoral to ‘swipe left’ on potential romantic partners based on physical appearance? How should self-driving cars handle ethical trade-offs?) The class will not presume any background in philosophy or technology studies, and will use technological developments as a springboard into philosophy. 1 Credit. Session B: July 1 – August 2.

The Guardian defined the 2010s as the \"mass protest decade.\" In 2020, amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, the US witnessed the widest protests in its recent history in response to the George Floyd killing. Last year, civil unrest in Africa hit a 6-year high, and this year, farmers in India and Europe have been demonstrating against dropping produce prices, rising fuel costs, and environmental reforms. Protesting has been normalized as a type of political participation, but mass protests appear to have lost momentum. Under what conditions does a protest start? Do protests succeed? Can repression kill protest movements? Focusing on recent protest movements worldwide, this seminar will address these and other questions to understand protests’ potential impact better. 1 Credit.

    "description": "This intensive six-week course is the equivalent of a two-term course covering the basics of New Testament, or Koine, Greek. The course begins by focusing on the grammar, syntax, and vocabulary needed to begin reading the New Testament and the Septuagint. As students gain greater facility with Greek, this course shifts to reading New Testament and early Christian texts with greater speed and accuracy, as well as understanding the critical apparatus found in the standard editions of the Greek New Testament. No prior knowledge of Greek is assumed. The course starts with the alphabet and continues from there. Completion of REL 3609 earns six hours of credit, equivalent to two full-term courses. This intensive course prepares students to take the Greek Exegesis courses offered at YDS.",

    "description": "Course cancelled. In-person Course. Philosophy in India has a venerable history: analytically demanding and conceptually innovative; rigorous, daring, theoretically innovative and potentially transformative—its ongoing story involves some of the oldest traditions of thought in the world while somehow still remaining cutting edge: Is their consciousness in deep sleep? Do humans admit of distinctions of natural kinds (as some have maintained with caste or race)? Are absences a true part of the furniture of the world and can we see them? Are we nothing but bodies? Can it be possibly true that ultimately nothing exists? By exploring questions such as these, this course introduces students to some of the practices, concepts, and arguments necessary to take up further study in this exciting subject. No background knowledge is presupposed, though the virtues of curiosity and delight in puzzling out problems are invaluable. At the end of the course, students will also get to use a philosophy textbook prepared for premodern students in a premodern Indian Buddhist university. Students at the end of this course will gain access to concepts and practices that will enable them to pursue further work in this area or other relevant areas of contemporary philosophical debate. 1 Credit.

    "description": "Course closed to further enrollment. In-person Course. Sociology is the foundation of the social sciences. It involves the systematic and rigorous study of human social relations, social structures, and social causes and consequences of human behavior. Studying sociology allows students to acquire what C. Wright Mills called the sociological imagination: the ability to think beyond our personal lives and to connect the experiences of individuals within the context of broader social forces. This introductory course provides a broad view of sociology by covering its major theoretical traditions (e.g., Marx, Weber, Durkheim, and Du Bois), primary research methods (interviews, ethnography, surveys, experiments, and social network analysis), and select substantive topics (e.g., socialization, family, race/ethnic relations, gender, culture, deviance, and social stratification). This course will primarily draw on readings and examples from the United States, though cross-national comparisons will also be incorporated whenever possible. 1 Credit. Session B: July 1 – August 2.

This seminar reads illustrative texts of dramatic literature from the Anglo-European world in, roughly, the twentieth century and the two adjacent \"turns of the century.\"  We will read with an eye toward discovering the unique ways authors adjusted theatrical form, content, and event to new conditions of modernity.  Our specific focus will be close-reading plays, looking at how playwrights create worlds through devices such as plot, characterization, imagery, etc., as well as through the conception of the audience/performer relationship; considerations of time, tempo, musicality; visual dramaturgy; non-linearity and repetition; coding and transcribing; and other dramaturgical devices that took on unique importance and new forms in the modern era.  We will read one play a week, establishing its historical context and examining different approaches of playwriting and world-making. 1 Credit.

    "description": "Course cancelled. Online Course. This course investigates the literary archive of queer and trans desire in America since World War I. Drawing on aesthetic and theoretical texts, we will examine the way sexuality articulates within economic, racial, and political formations. Our historical survey begins with the queer poets of the Harlem Renaissance, and Saidiya Hartman’s speculative Black feminist history of alternative sexualities in the early 20th century. From there we turn to post-World War II visions of sexual difference, from Frank O’Hara and Andy Warhol’s camp cosmopolitanism to Adrienne Rich and Audre Lorde’s radical feminist intimacies. The course concludes with two interrelated conversations. First, an interrogation of the enmeshment of race, class, and desire in neoliberal America, as explored in Samuel Delaney’s experimental memoir Times Square Red, Times Square Blue, AIDS elegies by Essex Hemphill and John Keene, and philosophical readings by theorists such as Cathy Cohen and Jasbir Puar. Secondly, a comparison of the way Queer Studies and Trans Studies approach questions of embodiment, agency, and the erotics of politics. 1 Credit. Session A: May 27 – June 28. Tuition: $5070.

    "description": "Course closed to further enrollment. In-person Course. Big cities present a unique set of opportunities and challenges. They are hubs of art and culture, media and entertainment, business and finance, and food. They serve as canvases for architects and urban planners with visions for the future. They represent the greatest potential for diverse populations to intersect and thrive. At the same time, cities are often sites of injustice, economic inequality, violence, and social division. Cities constantly challenge us to forge communities on a large scale and to learn how to live harmoniously with each other. \n\n\nIn this course, we will explore city life through reading and writing about cities in several non-fiction modes. Major assignments will include a literary personal essay, a reported journalistic feature (which can be a profile), a film review about a city film, and a policy memo/proposal about a change to city infrastructure. We will supplement our course readings in these four genres with short readings in other genres, as well as with other kinds of \"texts\" (images, films, recorded talks). We will also look for opportunities to use New Haven, the city around us, as a source and a test case for our ideas. Through our study and practice of non-fiction writing for a range of audiences, we will seek to join an ongoing (written) conversation about the past, present, and future of the modern city.

    "description": "In-person Course. The course will examine what and how we know about past climate change and what role these changes played in historical societal adaptations. We will explore the deep history of Earth's climate system and how a wide variety of human societies have understood and responded to sudden and longer term changes, why this matters for understanding current climate change, and how historical experience might inform policies and adaptations in the future. The reasons for the rise and fall of human civilizations have been debated in the West since Edward Gibbon published the first installment of The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire in 1776. As great as Gibbon’s work is, it was actually the 14th century Islamic historian Ibn Khaldun who first theorized the basic ideas of why and how states rise and fall. From Gibbon onward there has been considerable work in several fields, among them History, Archaeology, Economics, Sociology and Political Science, addressing the basic question: Are some societies more durable than others? Why was the Roman Empire enduring while the empires of the ancient Near East experienced cycles of rise and decline? The idea that history moved in \"cycles\" or \"waves\" was first made popular by Oswald Spengler’s The Decline of the West (1918-22), although the cyclical idea of history goes back to the ancient Greeks. It has come roaring back into fashion in recent historical work and in popular discourse as well. It was made especially popular by Malcolm Gladwell in his The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference. This kind of thinking can explain much, but not everything, about patterns in human history and behavior. 1 Credit. Session B: July 1 – August 2. Tuition: $5070.",

    "description": "Course closed to further enrollment. In-person Course. Trust involves a tension. On the one hand, we must build trust on the basis of its absence. On the other hand, trust is best built when a measure of it already exists between those who are trying to strengthen it. What is trust, such that violations of it yield a sense of betrayal rather than mere disappointment? What is the relation between epistemic and practical trust? When, if ever, is it rational to place one's trust in someone, some group or some thing – or to mistrust them? Can philosophers be proponents of the value of trust without ceding our role as critical, skeptical, even mistrustful thinkers? The topic has timely social and political implications. Liberal democracy depends upon citizens trusting that they share a common world and set of institutions enabling them to negotiate differences fairly. The aim of enemies of democracy is to sow doubts in the public so as to undermine trust in democratic institutions. This invites a consideration of phenomena such as polarization, epistemic bubbles, echo chambers, populism, conspiracy theories, \"truth decay,\" and even the idea of \"a post-truth culture.\" In the face of these challenges, how can we hope to rebuild trust in one another and democratic institutions? Enrollment limited to 20 students. 1 Credit.

    "description": "Online Course. Mathematical modeling is not a scripted procedure. Models are constrained by physical principles, including conservation laws and experimental observations but this does not provide a closed description. There is a lot more art in mathematical modeling than is commonly acknowledged and improvisation plays a significant role.  The artistic aspects are important and intellectually engaging because they often lead to a deeper understanding. This course provides a general introduction to engineering analysis and to chemical engineering principles. Material includes the derivation of governing equations from first principles and the analysis of these equations, including underlying assumptions, degrees of freedom, dimensional analysis, scaling arguments, and approximation techniques. The goal of this course is to obtain the necessary skills for improvising mathematical models for a broad range of problems that arise in engineering, science and everyday life. Students from all majors are encouraged to take this course. Enrollment limited to 25 students. 1 Credit. Session A: May 27 – June 28. Tuition: $5070. Technology Fee: $85.",

We will ask many questions of these texts, not the least of which is \"what do we mean when we say ‘American?’\" Given the wide range of the body of work that comprises American literature, however, we will also periodically ask in passing what we mean by \"literature,\" so as to consider what roles the literary plays in creating and shaping the possibilities of social imagination, private and public discourse, as well as one’s own identity. Emphasis on analytical reading, critical writing, and class discussions. Authors include Melville, Poe, Hawthorne, Whitman, Dickinson, Barnes, Toomer, H. Crane, W. C. Williams, L. Hughes, and M.

    "description": "Online Course. This course examines constitutional principles of due process and fair trial, and how bias influences the criminal justice system, focusing on wrongful convictions and the death penalty. Ethical considerations are a key component of the course. Iconic films demonstrate the issues presented. Topics include the efficacy of the death penalty, the causes of wrongful convictions, actual innocence, gender/race/economic bias and its effect on the justice system, and best practices for improving our sense of justice in the United States. This course explores the varying roles of the court, the prosecution and the defense in criminal cases, including analysis of ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Students develop an understanding of conflicting views on the legitimacy of the death penalty and the systemic problems with instituting capital punishment, as well as best practices to prevent wrongful convictions. Enrollment limited to 20 students. For college students and beyond. 1 Credit.

We will explore such questions as: What are the causes and effects of political polarization? How would term limits affect policy outcomes? What is the effect of money on Congress? Where do/should constituents fit in in all this? How does Congress interact with the President and the bureaucracy? How does one run for office? Why is Congress’s approval rating lower than any other institution in the country? The course is divided into two parts. In Part I, we discuss the theoretical and historical foundations of legislative government the United States. In Part II, we move beyond theories of legislating and on to the way Congress operates in practice. Enrollment limited to 20 students. 1 Credit. Session A: May 27 – June 28. Tuition: $5070.

    "description": "Online Course. This seminar directly tackles the urgent crises of our times—reproductive policing, climate change, pandemics, artificial intelligence, and systemic violence—through the lens of feminist and queer perspectives in ethnography. Students are encouraged to interrogate the formations of crises and catastrophes by resisting the narrative of exceptionalism in our era. This course is about learning historical and contemporary conditions of political possibility. Anchored in the \"radical hope for living otherwise,\" it is also about expanding intellectual horizons and building the tools to dream of, and work towards, the world(s) to come. 1 Credit.

The focus of this class is the digital making of still color photographs with particular emphasis on the potential meaning of images in a photo-saturated world. Through picture-making, students develop a personal visual syntax using color and composition for effect, meaning, psychology and narrative possibility. Students produce original work using a required digital camera. Introduction to a range of tools including color correction and fine-tuning. Assignments include prompts, regular critiques with active participation and a final project. Lectures examine the progression of photography as fine art medium and the tradition of handheld, natural-light photography through the 20th century and into contemporary practices in the 21st, focusing on a diversity of voices. Images are discussed and critiqued projected onscreen, and the focus is on the image rather than on the print as object, as students will not learn inkjet printing or have after-hours lab access in this course. Students must have access to a digital camera (DSLR, point-and-shoot or smartphone) and bring it to class.  Enrollment limited to 15 students. 1 Credit.

For some, another language might be natively known, or laboriously acquired to the point of fluency in adult years; others may live with a second language that has been partially lost, suppressed, or broken (and perhaps later revived and reclaimed). We will read poems, plays, short stories, and novels in which various proficiencies in another language are met with restlessness, exuberance, anxiety, humor, and ingenuity. Thinking about how language and identity are bound together in vital and surprisingly elastic ways, we will consider how knowledge of a second language can impress itself on the imagination, on literature—even on one’s very sense of self. 1 Credit.

    "description": "Online Course. This course offers a survey of literature’s role in anticipating and constructing potential \"futures\" from ancient times through the Enlightenment and on into the twentieth century. Questions explored in this course will include: What do we mean by \"futurity\"? What does it mean to \"anticipate\" the future? How have authors attempted to make sense of the philosophical complexities of multiple futures? What unique qualities does literature offer in anticipating or imagining the myriad of possible futures? Analyzing the longer history of literary \"futurism,\" this course explores what literature can tell us about this most human need: to understand what’s coming and how to respond to it. 1 Credit.

    "description": "Course closed to further enrollment. In-person Course. This seminar explores the history of right-wing political thought from the late eighteenth century to the present, with an emphasis on the role played by religious and pagan traditions. This course seeks to answer the questions: what constitutes the right? What are the central principles and values of those groups associated with this designation? And what are the defining features of what is commonly referred to as the \"global right?\" It will do so by examining primary tracts written by theologians, political philosophers, and social theorists as well as secondary literature written by scholars interrogating various movements and ideologies associated with the Right in America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Though touching on specific national political parties, institutions, and think tanks, its focus will be on mapping the intellectual similarities and differences between various right-wing ideologies. The \"Right\" emerged alongside its counterpoint, the \"left,\" as early as 1692 to describe the congregation patterns surrounding the French Monarch, but it was not until the Revolution of 1789 when it gained its current political meaning. As the French Chamber of Deputies debated the rights of man and royal veto powers it was suggested that opponents to these measures sit du côté droit, while supporters place themselves du côté gauche. The division, many complained, was too absolute and left no room for nuance or political idiosyncrasies. Yet the arrangement held, the terms stuck, and by mid-century the right had begun to be a catchall for a host of political groups, including conservatives, traditionalists, authoritarians, royalists, nationalists and papists. By the twentieth century the term would be stretched to include movements ranging from Fascism to Populism and would be used to describe the political position of political parties in the Middle East and Asia. Though primarily associated with European and parliamentary politics, increasingly the designation of the right has been applied to Evangelical and Judeo-Christian groups in the United States.

    "description": "Online Course. South Asian Americans have appeared on U.S. stages since the late nineteenth century, yet performances created by South Asian American artists have only just begun, in the last thirty years, to successfully dismantle dominant representations of South Asian and South Asian American communities and to imagine new ways of belonging. This seminar introduces you to contemporary works of performance (plays, stand-up sets, multimedia events) written and created by U.S.-based artists of South Asian descent as well as artists of the South Asian diaspora whose works have had an impact on U.S. audiences. With awareness that the South Asian American diaspora comprises multiple, contested, and contingent identities, we investigate how artists have worked to manifest complex representations of South Asian Americans onstage, challenge institutional and professional norms, and navigate the perils and pleasures of becoming visible. 1 Credit.

    "description": "This course offers, through case studies, a stratigraphic overview of the reception of Greco-Roman literature and culture in the British Isles. It is not intended as a history or material culture course; rather, as a study in classical reception: that is, how Greek and Roman material has been transmitted, translated, excerpted, interpreted, rewritten, re-imaged and represented in Britain from the Roman conquest through to the present. After a week’s introduction to the British Isles from the point of view of antiquity, we concentrate on material from the 18th-21st centuries. Each class asks students both to see antiquity through the eyes of the work/authors/artists assigned and to critique that gaze from their own, contemporary perspective.",

Enrollment subject to the permission of the instructors and satisfactory completion of all required preparatory course work.) This intensive five-week summer workshop takes place in Rome and is designed to provide a broad overview of that city’s major architectural sites, topography, and systems of urban organization. Examples from antiquity to the present day are studied as part of the context of an ever-changing city with its sequence of layered accretions. The seminar examines historical continuity and change as well as the ways in which and the reasons why some elements and approaches were maintained over time and others abandoned. Hand drawing is used as a primary tool of discovery during explorations of buildings, landscapes, and gardens, both within and outside the city. Students devote the final week to an intensive independent analysis of a building or place. M.Arch. I students are eligible to enroll in this course after completing at least three terms. This course does not fulfill either the History and Theory or the Urbanism and Landscape elective requirements. All program travel plans will be made in accordance with University and national travel policies. Limited enrollment.",
